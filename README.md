Any User can just upload documents here. The technology which I have used here is IPFS(inter plenetary file system).All the documents are stored cryptographicaly hased.With the content identifer, I can access the documents.Blockchain is very safe to store all data.For security reason,I have implemented face recognition.When User wants to upload its documents first its face is matched with live face.If it is matches with registered face image then upload option will be open.
